	Fix potential crash
	Fetch all regions from the window property and use all of those.
	addDataOpToFunctionData() already supports vararg
	The sample clients need xfixes libs and cflags
	Fix memory leak when fetching the window regions
	Add the XColor header.
	Use the _NET_COLOR_PROFILES to store profiles in the root window.
	Use XColorRegion to communicate the window regions.
