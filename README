libXcm:

    The libXcm library contains the a reference implementation of the net-color
    spec. The net-color spec allows to attach colour regions to X windows to 
    communicate with colour servers.

    The XcmDDC API can be used to fetch a EDID data block from a monitor over
    a i2c communication. On Linux typical the i2c-dev module
    must be loaded to use this hardware data channel. The device nodes
    must obtain rights accessible to normal users.

    The XcmEdidParse API is for parsing EDID data blocks. A small example 
    application is included.

    The XcmEvents API allowes to easily observe X11 colour management events.
    The included xcmsevents makes use of the XcmEvents API.
